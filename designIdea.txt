MineCraft Mod MCTea Design Rough Draft

A mod of breedable Teas, functioning similarly to potions creating buffs and debuffs.

Items:

Bucket of Hot Water
	-Smelt Water Bucket

Tea (Basic)
	-Shapeless Craft: Bucket of Hot Water + 1 Tree Leaves Block (Compatible with Forestry/BoP/XBXL?)
	-Clears all Buffs, Debuffs, all Potions effects.

Tree Breeding/Harvesting:
	-Several ideas, just have to choose one.
		-Tea seeds work like vanilla crops, but need fenceposts for the Tea Vines to grow upward through. Harvestable via Shears.
		-Tea Trees, harvest leaves via shears.
		-Shapeless Craft vanilla leaves to get Tea Leaves, craft Tea Leaves with buff-based items to receive potion buffs from teas.

Making Tea:
	-Make Tea Cup item? Or use vanilla bottles?
	-Tea Kettle Block?
	-Do not register any Teas as Forge Fluids, except possibly basic tea.
